# Platform.NETClient-Async-Samples
*Platform.NETClient* makes it easy to start using [DocuWare Platform .NET API](http://help.docuware.com/sdk/platform).  

Here you will find a *Visual Studio* solution that contains a basic implemenation of a client showing how to use *Platform .NET API* and some examples showing basic operations you can do.  

This *Visual Studio* solution is supposed to complement examples that could be found on the help page of [DocuWare Platform .NET API](http://help.docuware.com/sdk/platform) and it could/will be updated more often than the help page which is usually updated once per release.

Additionally, everyone is very welcome to provide missing code examples.
